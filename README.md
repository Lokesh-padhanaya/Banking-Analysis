The primary aim is to demonstrate how customer data can be analyzed and visualized to identify potential lending risks. Through this, banks and financial institutions can make more informed and data-driven lending decisions, reducing the chances of default and improving portfolio health.
This project focuses on developing a basic understanding of risk analytics in the context of banking and financial services. The goal is to explore how data can be leveraged to minimize the risk of financial loss, particularly in the process of lending to customers.
Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI / Tableau (for dashboard, if used)
- Excel (for data preprocessing, if used)
- The dashboard provides financial institutions with a data-driven overview to support credit decisions. It helps minimize risk by clearly identifying high-risk customers and offering insights into customer behavior.
